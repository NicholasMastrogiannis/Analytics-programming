## Load data for Later use.

```{r}
patient_data <- read.csv("patientsUG.csv")
encounters_data <- read.csv("encountersUG.csv")
conditions_data <- read.csv("conditionsUG.csv")
```

## Task 1 Write the code to analyse the distribution of COVID patients (confirmed or suspected) across counties And code to investigate the distribution of patients across age groups (e.g., 0-18,
19-35, 36-50, 51+). Visualise both the findings using the histogram. Explain your findings.

```{r}
#load libraries
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(lubridate)
library(readr)

```

```{r}
#Identify COVID patients based on diagnosis description
covid_patients <- conditions_data |>
  filter(grepl("COVID|SARS|coronavirus", DESCRIPTION, ignore.case = TRUE)) |>
  distinct(PATIENT)

# Join with patient demographic data to figure out Id
covid_data <- patient_data |>
  inner_join(covid_patients, by = c("Id" = "PATIENT"))

#Calculate current age for each patient
patient_data <- patient_data |>
  mutate(
    BIRTHDATE = as.Date(BIRTHDATE),
    age = as.numeric(floor((Sys.Date() - BIRTHDATE) / 365.25)),
    age_group = case_when(
      age <= 18 ~ "0-18",
      age <= 35 ~ "19-35",
      age <= 50 ~ "36-50",
      age > 50  ~ "51+",
      TRUE ~ NA_character_
    )
  )
# Merging age groups with COVID data
covid_data <- covid_data |>
  left_join(select(patient_data, Id, age_group), by = "Id")

```

### Visualisation 1: COVID distribution across counties

```{r}
ggplot(covid_data, aes(x = COUNTY)) +
  geom_bar(fill = "steelblue") +
  labs(
    title = "Distribution of COVID Patients Across Counties",
    x = "County",
    y = "Number of Patients"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```

### Visualisation 2: Patient distribution across age groups

```{r}
ggplot(patient_data, aes(x = age_group)) +
  geom_bar(fill = "darkorange") +
  labs(
    title = "Distribution of Patients Across Age Groups",
    x = "Age Group",
    y = "Number of Patients"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```

### Understanding the task
```{r}
#The task requires identifying COVID-19–related patients from the health datasets and analyzing how they are distributed across counties and age groups (0–18, 19–35, 36–50, 51+). It also asks for correct data wrangling, clean R code, and interpretation supported by visualizations.
```

### Rationale
```{r}
#Used tidyverse packages (dplyr, ggplot2, lubridate) for consistent and readable analysis.
#Filtered conditions_data for keywords like COVID, SARS, or coronavirus.
#Joined with patient_data to access demographics.
#Calculated age and grouped into categories for population analysis.
#Used histograms for clear visual comparison.
```

### Findings and interpretation

```{r}
#COVID by County: Certain counties had noticeably higher case counts, likely due to population size or access to testing facilities.
#Patients by Age Group: Middle-aged (19–35) and older (51+) groups were most represented, indicating higher healthcare interaction in these populations.
